### What I learned

this week i learn that forums dedicated to programmers arent exactly a place where you can ask for questions they offer no help whatsoever will try to stick with chatgpt as much as i can

Also i learn that  you can copy paste code as long as you modify it.I will be honest i found this code for the solution in front end mentor but i wanted to understand it so after many hours of pulling and disecting the code i couldnt understand HOW it work and specially HOW it is making the cut on the image BUT it works. In the end i left the <picture> and the hero CSS just at it is i will keep trying to understand it but if i cant find anything well i guess the meme of "i dont know what i m doing but is woring" is accurate.

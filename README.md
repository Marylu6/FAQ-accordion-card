### What I learned

this week i learn that forums dedicated to programmers arent exactly a place where you can ask for questions(almost no one answer questions and if they do is about how bad the code is presented and weirdly you have this "victim trolls" that will say, in a very angry manner unrelated to the question, that the code presented cant go to a screenreader or be assistive accesible probably saying it wrong but i search for it and it says that those things are use for incapacitated people who cant read and i think that the messega they are trying to say is that the code is so bad that a screenreader for disable people cant process it wtf XD hay whatever). 

Also i learn that  you can copy paste code as long as you modify it.I will be honest i found this code for the solution in front end mentor but i wanted to understand it so after many hours of pulling and disecting the code i couldnt understand HOW it work specially HOW it is making the cut on the image. In the end i left the <picture> and the hero CSS just at it is i will keep trying to understand it but if i cant find anything well i guess the meme of "i dont know what i m doing" is accurate.
